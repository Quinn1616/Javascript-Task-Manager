# Overview

As a software engineer, I continually seek opportunities to hone my skills and deepen my understanding of programming languages. In pursuit of this goal, I developed a simple JavaScript task manager to showcase my proficiency with the language and reinforce my knowledge of its syntax and concepts.

The task manager allows users to add and mark tasks as completed. It serves as a basic yet functional example of JavaScript programming.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I utilized the following tools:

- **Code Editor**: I used Visual Studio Code as my primary code editor due to its extensive support for JavaScript development.
- **Web Browser**: Chrome was my chosen web browser for testing and debugging the application.
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub were utilized for version control.

For the programming language, I used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Useful Websites

During the development process, I found the following websites particularly helpful:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): A comprehensive resource for JavaScript documentation.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

While the current version of the task manager meets basic functionality requirements, there are several areas for improvement and expansion in the future:

- Improve user interface: Enhance the visual design and user experience with additional styling and interactive elements.
- Add task prioritization: Introduce the ability to prioritize tasks and organize them accordingly.
